# Understanding Autism Spectrum Disorder

## What is Autism?
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. People with ASD often have problems with social communication and interaction, and restricted or repetitive behaviors or interests.

## Early Signs
- Avoids eye contact
- Delayed speech and communication skills
- Reliance on rules and routines
- Upset by relatively minor changes
- Unexpected reactions to sounds, tastes, sights, touch, and smells

## Diagnosis
Diagnosing ASD can be difficult since there is no medical test, like a blood test, to diagnose the disorders. Doctors look at the child's behavior and development to make a diagnosis.

ASD can sometimes be detected at 18 months or younger. By age 2, a diagnosis by an experienced professional can be considered very reliable. However, many children do not receive a final diagnosis until they are much older.

# Evidence-Based Interventions

## Early Start Denver Model (ESDM)
ESDM is a comprehensive behavioral early intervention approach for children with autism ages 12 to 48 months. It integrates a relationship-focused developmental model with the well-validated teaching practices of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA).

## JASPER (Joint Attention, Symbolic Play, Engagement, and Regulation)
JASPER is a treatment approach based on developmental and behavioral principles that targets the foundations of social communication (joint attention, imitation, and play).

## Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT)
PRT is a variation of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) type therapy. It focuses on "pivotal" areas of a child's development, such as motivation and response to multiple cues, rather than targeting individual behaviors.

# Sensory Processing Strategies

## Creating a Sensory-Friendly Environment
- **Visuals**: Reduce visual clutter. Use visual schedules.
- **Lighting**: Use natural light when possible. Avoid flickering fluorescent lights.
- **Noise**: Provide noise-cancelling headphones. Create a quiet corner.

## Sensory Breaks
Allow for regular sensory breaks throughout the day. This could include:
- Heavy work activities (carrying books, pushing a cart)
- Fidget tools
- Movement breaks

# Navigating Employment

## Disclosure
Deciding whether to disclose your diagnosis is a personal choice. You are not legally required to disclose unless you are asking for reasonable accommodations.

## Accommodations
Common accommodations include:
- Noise-cancelling headphones
- Flexible work hours
- Written instructions instead of verbal
- A quiet workspace

## Finding Inclusive Employers
Look for companies with specific neurodiversity hiring programs. Many large tech companies and financial institutions have programs designed to recruit and support neurodivergent talent.
